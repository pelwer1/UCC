Update Compendium Creature

 Script to modify SWADE Compendium creatures to work with my high-efficiency GM macros and workflow

 It works by adding a few attribute fields to the character that are ignored by the character sheet code

 It also produces a tokenmod command to help you see certain edges and abilities in the token name
